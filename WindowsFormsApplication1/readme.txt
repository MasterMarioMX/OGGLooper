Ogg Looper by MasterMarioMX

This software is made posible with Libraries made by Mark Heath. (NAudio)

Thanks for using this software! I hope you find it uselful and maybe get fun using it. 
but for NOW!!!!....the obligatory README Notes:

I made this thing so you (and I) don't have problems converting and editing music loops for your favorite RPG maker
programs that support it ('cuz it's in MP3 or stuff) and to prevent the hassle to convert, edit tags, 
and wannot in various programs and do it all in a single program instead (I am currently utilizing 
cool edit pro for loop finding and formating + winamp for the OGG tags, for example) 
and ALSO be able to preview that sweet loop you just figure out (almost like audacy, except it loops from the get go 
and straigth to bussiness) without the need to preview it on RPG maker and LISTEN if it sounds good to boot.

or at least that's the goal! but since I am a busy man(child), I have little to no time to advance this, and if Anyone
can make this thing with a spectroscope view of the sound (which is MILES easier for the purposes to find a 
point in music to find a loop point than the clasic waveform view...if you know what the blurb I am talking
about of course), I guess I'll be grateful in the least.

Make sure the Resources folder is in place and make sure you have at least one resx file there, otherwise, 
THIS THING EXPLODES!.

that's all for now and thanks for reading this boring readme file!
