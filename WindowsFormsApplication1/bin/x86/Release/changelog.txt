Version 0.0.1:		
*First entry of this writing shenganingans, but here's for you to inform from little bug squashes to major overhauls in the interface, just to keep you up to date.

Version 0.0.1.2:	
+Play with WAV Files for the first time. Can only play or stop'em on the spot.
*Can choose between WAVs and OGGs, but time can only tell when on earth I get OGG dlls to work with the prog, so for now I leave it as "soon".

Version 0.0.1.3:
+Added support for localization. There's currently 2 languages, en-US(THIS LANGUAGE) and es-MX(my native language, spanish). Sorry if the default language is spanish, but ENGLISH IS NOT MY DEFAULT LANGUAGE.

Version 0.0.1.4
+Added the ability to read OGG Tags! thanks to http://www.jockersoft.com/ NOW I can start to have fun once I deduced how to read the AUDIO from an ogg. For now I only read the tags, not modify them.

Version 0.0.1.5
*FINALLY Fixed the bug that prevented me from reading loop tags as they start the same. Unfortunately, this means I modded jockersoft's dll so they are no longer the same. But who cares? As long as it works and he is credited.

Version 0.0.2.0
*AT LAST! being able to play OGG and WAVs as well. Gotta use an API for it, but it's worth it. Before I add conversion to moar formats, Better check that MP3 license issue...
+The API make jokersoft's plugin redundant, but I keep it since it's easier to program with the later.
*It can NOW Read, Play, Pause and Stop WAVs Properly, As Mankind Intended, thanks again, to the New API.
+Added a Volume Knob.

Version 0.0.2.1
+Added Mp3 Support! If NAudio let's you read it, let's do it once and For all. No royalties given since the program is basically free!
+Added a Pitch slider, but doesn't work for now.
+Added experimental loop support, it's still bugged as crazy, so only works on ogg for now.
+It can read some file attributes, if the program doesn't know how to read the file's song name, it will place the file's name instead.					
*It can read, pause and stop ALL of the supported formats now. (OGG, WAV and MP3 if you keep track of it)
*Corrected some bugs that make the program a memory whore, and the program now closes files correctly. better be efficient!
*Minor Quality changes as remembering your last opened file type and NOT closing audio every time you want to open a file.

Version 0.0.2.2
-Ditched the loop button AND...
*Implemented seamless loop, but only at WAV files and at THE BEGGINING OF THE MUSIC ONLY! theorically it CAN loop...but gotta debug it.

Version 0.0.2.3
*Now all OGG Files should loop seamlessly now that I FINALLY Figure out how to loop properly. freaking rule of 3 always useful even 15 years after school...
@Found a bug that prevents you to load a previously loaded OGG, and it's a problem with the Jokersoft dll. -Solved by getting rid of jokersoft.
*Gotta ditch the Jokersoft and finally dignified myself to do a class for tag reading. It was easy thanks to NAudio. 
	 for Maybe read all the (formats) tags. But for now, it only reads the OGG Tags, the tags I really need to know for now.
	 this also permited me to seamlessly loop.

Version 0.0.2.4
+Added the hability to properly loop on songs whose loop lenght is shorter than whatever time is left after the loop starts. TLTR
	looplenght finally works as intended (mostly), But not as precissely as desired but whatever.
+Added a trackbar so you can play the song at the desired position.
