Ogg Looper by MasterMarioMX

This software is made posible with codecs made by Xiph.org Foundation And Libraries made by Mark Heath

Thanks for using this software! I hope you find it uselful and maybe get fun using it. 
but for NOW!!!!....the obligatory README Notes:

I made this thing so you (and I) don't have problems converting and editing music loops for your favorite RPG maker
programs that support it ('cuz it's in MP3 or stuff) and to prevent the hassle to convert, edit tags, 
and wannot in various programs and do it all in a single program instead and ALSO be able to preview 
that sweet loop you just figure out.

ANYWAY, it can potentially make a simplier loop etiqueter for so many more 
software that uses OGG tags so you can seamlessly loop or convert for another program if demand and/or
popularity is high enough.

Make sure the Resources folder is in place and make sure you have at least one resx file there, otherwise, 
THIS THING EXPLODES!.

And if you for some reason screw up the configurations or wanna go "commando" with the defaults, 
just delete the settings file, presto!.

that's all for now and thanks for reading this boring file!
